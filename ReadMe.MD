Universial Blocker will be avalible soon on April 21st. For now stay tuned on updates because the code will NOT be here.

If you're wondering why, let me give you some context. If the code were to be widely accesible, this would lead to one of two things. Either someone who works for internet security at your school would block this github page or block github entirely. The other one is that people can easily extract my code and do it for bad. 

If you want to collab let me know in Issues, but you will need to fill me a "resume" basically explaining in short sentences what you do and can do to further expand on this project.
